      "The third time was definitely a charm when it came to the Air Jordan line back in 1988. But could designer Tinker Hatfield and Nike top—or even come close—to the success of the bold and stylish Air Jordan III for 1989’s new model? As we now know, the answer was most certainly yes. The Air Jordan IV began right where the III left off, further establishing the Air Jordan line’s status as the coolest and most important sneakers in the world. In this latest episode of the Jordan 101 series, we review all of the basic details, legendary on and off court moments, and cultural importance of the Air Jordan IV. Continue reading to study up on one of the greatest Air Jordans of all time.",

      "Tinker’s Second Legendary Air Jordan Design Following up the Air Jordan III was no easy task, but if anybody could do it, it was Tinker Hatfield. And do it he did, quite successfully. The IV’s design actually didn’t stray too far from the III, with the mid-cut height and visible heel Air unit both returning. However, the IV was a bit more streamlined and lighter-weight than the III. It’s signature design details were the mesh netting on the side panels and tongue, and the unique lacing support system with the shoe’s iconic “wings”. The Air Jordan IV also introduced the “Flight” concept to the Air Jordan line.",

      "The Air Jordan IV may not have introduced any groundbreaking new technology to the basketball shoe world like many other Air Jordans, but everything it did have was functional and aesthetically pleasing. Already mentioned above, the IV brought back the mid-top height and visible Air, while other tech aspects of the shoe included additional Air in the forefoot, the supportive “wings”, a lacing system which provided multiple eyelets for custom lace placement, and the large heel pull tab for easy access. The “Bred” colorway also introduced soft nubuck leather to Air Jordans, a material that would be used on many following models.",

      "It’s Gotta Be The Shoes During the 1988-89 season in which Michael wore the Air Jordan IV, he achieved his overall best statistical season with averages of 32.5 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists. It would still be two more seasons until MJ and the Bulls made it to the Finals (which they ultimately won), but the ‘88-89 season saw the Bulls make their first Eastern Conference Finals of the Jordan era, firmly confirming them as a team to be taken serious for championship contention.",

      "While Back to the Future gave the design some retro-future chic, there are real, practical applications for self-lacing kicks. Shoes that lace themselves are great for people with disabilities, who may have trouble tying their shoes. Michael J. Fox himself suffers from Parkinson’s, and a letter from Nike that Fox tweeted out earlier today says money from the shoes will go to Fox’s foundation to fight Parkinson’s. That’s one condition we’d love to leave in the past.",

      "Ten years after its initial release, the Air Jordan IV returned as a retro in 1999 in its most beloved “Bred” and “White/Cement” colorways. (Something today’s Air Jordan shoppers certainly aren’t’ familiar with, the original ‘99 retros costed the same as the OG release at $100!) Along with the OG looks, the shoe also released in the first-ever Retro+ colorways of the Air Jordan line in the “Oreo” and “Columbia Blue” colorways with a White/Chrome version later in 2000—each constructed in full leather builds without mesh netting and Jumpmans replacing the heel Nike Air logo. The earliest Air Jordan retros in 1994, the Air Jordan 1, 2, and 3, had all been a little too soon for the sneaker world, with many pairs hitting sale racks. But we were all ready for the Air Jordan 4’s comeback in 1999, as the retro craze would officially begin from that point on.",
